### How to implement board color changed

origin text (usually be code/plain text)

typed text (usually be code/plain text)


html text (should be generated by algor using origin and typed)

#### what im thinking to do

the current version is messedup, garbaged, and I'm finding another way.

**There will be a specific object that**
1. keep good typed chars
2. keep all typed_chars
3. keep error typed chars

it should be an array, and each item should be a object include:
{
  char, <- the char itself
  status: NONE(0), <-- it should be at origin version, or GOOD(1) - it was typed, and corrected, or ERROR('char') if it wrong
}

it have some functions including:
- typeAt: update char status at position (may use in some special case)
- type: update char status at cursor position  (called when typed)
- cursor: get current position
- renderHtml : render the html based on data
- errors : count all status === ERROR
- accuracy : errors * 100 / length
- progress: blink_position * 100 / length
- lines : total lines of original text
- line: current line based on cursor

*** rendering the html ***
  - for each item:
    check status with current open bracket normal, good (<span>), error (<mark>)
      - if diff, close current bracket, set current open bracket to new one
      - if equal, just append
